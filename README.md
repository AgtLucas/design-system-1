# Nulogy Design System 
The Nulogy Design System is a collection of Visual Guidelines and UI Components that will allow designers and developers to quickly create consistent experiences for our customers using established best practices.

## Components 
The primary way to interface with the system is by using our React components. They can be found in a package called [@nulogy/components](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system/tree/master/components).

## CSS 
If your application can't use React components we also provide atomic CSS classes and Sass variables to build your own interface in Nulogy's style. These can be found in a package called [@nulogy/css](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system/tree/master/css).

## Tokens
Design tokens are stored in their own package called [@nulogy/tokens](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system/tree/master/tokens). These are mostly used to build our Components and CSS packages above, but can also be imported directly into your application if needed. 

## UI Kit
Designers can use the Nulogy Design System in Sketch by downloading the [Sketch UI Kit](https://share.goabstract.com/73221fd2-6626-43c8-b95c-e4bec74741ab)

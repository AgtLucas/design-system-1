@nulogy/css uses styled-components [Inject Global](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#injectglobal) to apply default styles to your application, including:

1) CSS reset [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/)
2) [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/), the new typeface of Nulogy applications

It will also expose the collection of CSS classes referenced throughout [nulogy.design](http://nulogy.design).

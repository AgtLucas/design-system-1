Nulogy uses Sketch as our primary design tool. There are a few things you can do to start working with the Nulogy Design System in Sketch.

### [Download Sketch UI Kit](https://share.goabstract.com/73221fd2-6626-43c8-b95c-e4bec74741ab)
The Sketch Library is a collection of colour palettes, type styles and components. Start each project with this file to ensure you’re able to use the Nulogy Design System to its fullest.

### Update Nudging Settings
Our spacing system uses an 8px unit of measurement, so it’s helpful to have nudging settings that match. These can be found in `Preferences > Nudging Settings`

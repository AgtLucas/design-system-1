# Getting Started
Nulogy uses [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) as our primary design tool. There are a few things you can do to start working with the Nulogy Design System in Sketch.

### Download typeface
[IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) is Nulogy's sole typeface.

### Download Sketch UI Kit 
The [Sketch UI Kit](https://share.goabstract.com/73221fd2-6626-43c8-b95c-e4bec74741ab) is a collection of colour palettes, type styles and components. Start each project with this file to ensure you’re able to use the Nulogy Design System to its fullest.

### Use Nulogy's spacing scale
Our spacing system uses an 8px unit of measurement, so it’s helpful to have nudging settings in Sketch that match. These can be found in `Preferences > Nudging Settings`.

Make sure to familiarize yourself with our [spacing scale](/style/spacing) to ensure your designs are easy to code consistently.

_That's it! Now you should be all set to design with the Nulogy Design System._

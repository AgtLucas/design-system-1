## Using components
The primary way to interface with the system is by using our React components. They can be found in a package called **[@nulogy/components](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system/tree/master/components)**

## Using CSS 
If your application can't use React components we also provide atomic CSS classes and Sass variables to build your own interface in Nulogy's style. These can be found in a package called **[@nulogy/css](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system/tree/master/css)**

## Using tokens
Design tokens are stored in their own package called **[@nulogy/tokens](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system/tree/master/tokens)**. These are mostly used to build our Components and CSS packages above, but can also be imported directly into your application if needed. 

## Contributing 
Please see **[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)** for up-to-date instructions on installing and contributing to the Nulogy Design System.

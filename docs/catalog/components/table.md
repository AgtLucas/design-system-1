##### Design


## Funcionality

### Actions
There are 2 types of actions:
- Row-level actions that allow data manipulation within a single row, and
- Table level actions that allow actions to be performed on multiple rows or the entire table. Table level actions also include actions such as Create, Print, Import/Export.

(More information: Actions component)

##### Intro

> Radio buttons are used when the user must select only one from a list of two or more options.

**Use when**
- Users need to make a single choice from a set of mutually exclusive options.
- You want to show all available choices to the user to reduce the cognitive load needed to make a selection and remove the click required in a drop-down menu.

```

## Default Button
Default buttons are used for actions that do not require any special emphasis and covers most cases.
```image
span: 5
src: "buttons/default.png"
```

## Primary Button
Primary buttons are used for the main action in a particular context. There is usually not more than one primary button per screen and not all of the screens require a Primary button.
```image
span: 5
src: "buttons/primary.png"
```

## Danger Button
Danger buttons are used for destructive actions such as deleting. They are most likely to appear in confirmation dialogs.
```image
span: 5
src: "buttons/danger.png"
```

## Quiet Button
Quiet buttons are used for less important actions such as â€œCancel" or actions that are not directly related to the context of the page (e.g *Learn more ...*). Quiet buttons are often paired with a Primary button.

## Writing guidelines
- Always lead with an actionable verb
- Whenever possible follow by an object noun on Primary button to reduce ambiguity. Example: Create shipment, Approve delivery.
- Always use sentence case

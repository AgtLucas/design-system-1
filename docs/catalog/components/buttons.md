## Default Button
Default button is used for actions that do not require any special emphasis and covers most of the standard cases.
```image
span: 5
src: "buttons/default.png"
```

## Primary Button
Primary buttons are used for primary action in a particular context. There is usually not more than one primary button per screen and not all of the screens require Primary button.
```image
span: 5

```

## Danger Button
Danger button is used for destructive action such as deleting. They are most likely to appear in confirmation dialogs.
```image
span: 5

```

## Quiet Button
Quiet button is used for less important actions such as â€œCancel" or actions that are not directly related to the context of the page (actions such as *Learn more ...*). Quiet button is often paired with Primary button.

### Writing guidelines
- Always lead with an actionable verb
- Whenever possible follow by an object noun on Primary button to reduce ambiguity. Example: Create shipment, Approve delivery.
- Always use sentence case

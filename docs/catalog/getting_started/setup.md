These docs are part of the larger [@nulogy/design-system](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system) project. This project uses [Yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) to manage multiple packages in one repository.

To work on Nulogy Design System, you will need to clone the repo to your machine, install necessary dependencies and run the development server. This document will guide you through that process.

# Clone the repo to your local machine

The repo is located at [https://github.com/nulogy/design-system](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system). 

You can clone the repo from the command line like so:

```code
lang: sh
---
$ cd ~/src/nulogy # or wherever you want to work
$ git clone https://github.com/nulogy/design-system.git design-system
$ cd design-system
```

# Installation

You will need to install NVM, Node, Direnv, and Yarn.

## NVM

[NVM is the Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). It allows you to install and switch between multiple versions of Node.

### Make sure your shell profile is setup

It seems that some Macs don't have a `~/.profile` set by default. You will need a shell profile set. 

Before installing NVM you will need to check if you have a shell profile: look for one of the following files: `~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile, or ~/.bashrc`.

If you don't have any of these, add one:

```code
lang:sh
---
$ touch ~/.profile
```
### Install NVM

[Follow the instructions on the NVM repo](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation).

## Node

Now that you have NVM installed, ensure that you have the correct version of node. 

Note that at the time of writing the correct version of node for NDS is `v8.11.3`, however you can check the version in the project's [`.nvmrc`](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system/blob/master/.nvmrc)

```code
lang:sh
---
$ nvm install node 8.11.3
```

## Direnv (optional)

[Direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) is a utility that will automatically set your environment to use the correct version of node.

Direnv can be installed from homebrew:

```code
lang:sh
---
$ brew install direnv
```

You will need to hook it into your shell. 

For bash add the following to your `/.bash_profile`:

```code
lang:sh
---
eval "$(direnv hook bash)"
```

For zsh add the following to your `/.zshrc`:

```code
lang:sh
---
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
```

[Check out the docs](https://github.com/direnv/direnv#setup) for installation on other shells.

## Yarn

Nulogy Design System uses the [Yarn package](https://yarnpkg.com/) manager to manage [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) dependencies. 

You can check if you have yarn installed by typing `yarn -v` in the terminal: 


```code
lang: sh
---
$ yarn -v
1.7.0 
```

If you see a version number like this you're good üëç

However, If you see this... 

```code
lang: sh
---
$ yarn -v
bash: command not found: yarn 
```

 ... then you'll need to install yarn by following the instructions for your platform on the yarn website: [https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

## Install dependencies and link local packages

The project uses Yarn Workspaces to allow you to install dependencies for all packages in the monorepo in one command.

From the repo root, type:

```code
lang: sh
---
$ yarn install
```

That's it! Yarn should pull down and install all project dependencies. Yarn will also create symlinks for dependencies across packages within the repo. Local changes across packages will instantly be reflected everywhere in the project without the need to publish and install new versions.

# Run the development server

The [nulogy.design](http://nulgoy.design) website is located in the `@nulogy/nulogy-design` package in the [`\docs`](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system/tree/master/docs) directory. 

You have a few options for how to work in the package. You can work directly in that package folder by `cd`ing to the `/docs` directory. You can also use the `yarn workspace <package name>` command to target commands to a particular package.

## Working in the /doc directory

Working in the `/docs` directory is the simplest way of working on the docs package. 

To run the dev server type the following form the repo root:

```code
lang: sh
---
$ cd docs/
$ yarn start
```

You should see output like the following:

```code
lang: sh
---
yarn run v1.7.0
$ catalog start

  Starting Catalog ‚Ä¶



 [DONE]  Compiled successfully in 5690ms    11:47:41

 [I]  Catalog is running at http://localhost:4000/
```

## Working with the `yarn workspace` command

Alternately, you can use the `yarn workspace` command to direct script commands to a particular sub package. 

To run commands on the `@nulogy/nulogy-design` package from anywhere in the project type:

```code
lang: sj
---
$ yarn workspace @nulogy/nulogy-design start
```

You should see output like the following:

```code
lang:sh
---
yarn workspace v1.7.0
yarn run v1.7.0
$ catalog start

  Starting Catalog ‚Ä¶



 [DONE]  Compiled successfully in 6331ms    12:06:41

 [I]  Catalog is running at http://localhost:4000/
 ```

### Aliases

There are also aliases in the root `package.json` that make it easier to work with the sub-packages. 

From the repo root you can run:

```code
lang: sh
---
$ yarn docs start
```

And you'll see out put like the following:

```code
lang: sh
---
yarn run v1.7.0
$ yarn workspace @nulogy/nulogy-design start
$ catalog start

  Starting Catalog ‚Ä¶
```

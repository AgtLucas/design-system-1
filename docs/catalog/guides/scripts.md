# Working with packages

You have a few options for how to work in the project's sub-package. You can work directly in that package folder by `cd`ing to the package's directory. You can also use the `yarn workspace <package name>` command to target commands to a particular package. Finally there are aliases in the root to all the packages.

## Working in the `/docs` directory


The [nulogy.design](http://nulgoy.design) website is located in the `@nulogy/nulogy-design` package in the [`/docs`](https://github.com/nulogy/design-system/tree/master/docs) directory. 

Working in the `/docs` directory is the simplest way of working on the docs package. 

To run the dev server type the following from the repo root:

```code
lang: sh
---
$ cd docs/
$ yarn start
```

## Working with the `yarn workspace` command

Alternately, you can use the `yarn workspace` command to direct script commands to a particular sub package. 

To run commands on the `@nulogy/nulogy-design` package from anywhere in the project type:

```code
lang: sh
---
$ yarn workspace @nulogy/components storybook
```

## Aliases

There are also aliases in the root `package.json` that make it easier to work with the sub-packages. 

From the repo root you can run:

```code
lang: sh
---
$ yarn docs build
```

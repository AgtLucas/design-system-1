## Learn 
The first thing to do when getting started designing for Nulogy products is to understand what the system is comprised of.

* [Visual Style]() - Get acquainted with all of the colours, font styles and icons available with the Nulogy Design System.
* [Components]() - The building blocks of our interfaces. It's important to understand what each component is and isn't for when creating interactions for our users.

## Download font and logo
Nulogy uses [IBM Plex Sans](https://www.ibm.com/plex) as our typeface for both headings and body text. Currently each product has a different logo, all of which are available at the link below.

## Working with Sketch

```
Nulogy uses [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) as our primary design tool. There are a few things you can do to start working with the Nulogy Design System in Sketch.

### 1) Download
Nulogy employees should have received a Sketch license as part of your on boarding. If that hasn't happened, [download a trial version](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and contact IT for a license.

### 2) Update Nudging settings

```
Our spacing system uses an 8px unit of measurement, so it's helpful to have nudging settings that match. These can be found in `Preferences > Nudging Settings`

### 3) Download Sketch Master file
The Sketch Master File is a collection of colour palettes, type styles and components. Start each project with this file to ensure you're able to use the Nulogy Design System to its fullest.

> A spacing scale is used to maintain consistent paddings between and within elements throughout our products. Sticking to a scale allows us to be more consistent and predictable, and makes our designs more harmonious.

## How to choose spacing
There are two important factors to consider when spacing: **size** and **relatedness**.

* Use less spacing inside smaller elements or between functionally related elements.
* Use more spacing inside larger elements or between less functionally related elements.

Note: `half` should mostly be used for spacing related items within an element, e.g a button's text and it's icon.

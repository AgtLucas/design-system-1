> Nulogy applications are data heavy and used in varying environments. Sticking to a typographic scale makes our applications more predictable and scannable for our users. Below are all the sizes and line heights available to use for Nulogy applications.

## Typeface
### IBM Plex Sans
[https://www.ibm.com/plex/](https://www.ibm.com/plex/)

## Headings
There are three levels of headings available for typographic heirarchy in an application.

```image
plain: true
src: "headings.svg"
```

## Interface text
By default, interface text should be set at 16px with a line height of 24px. Smaller text may be desirable for certain purposes and can be set at either 14px or 12px.

```image
plain: true
src: "text.svg"
```

### Line height
The default line heights above should be appropriate for most interfaces but if your design requires a different line height you can use 16px, 32px or 40px. 

## Usage
There are type components for headings and interface text available via React as well as token references for all sizes and line heights.

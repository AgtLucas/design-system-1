# @nulogy/tokens
This is where Nulogy's design tokens are stored and converted using [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary). Tokens are mostly used in our React components and CSS classes, but tokens can be imported directly into your application if needed. 

## What are tokens?
> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.
